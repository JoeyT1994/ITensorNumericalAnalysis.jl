Package for constructing, manipulating low-rank Tensor Network representations of multi-dimensional functions.

1. Represent standard elementary functions with complete flexibility over the tensor network's topology and arrangement of the bits which decompose your continuous variable
2. Solve multi-dimensional differential equations using tensor network ansatz
